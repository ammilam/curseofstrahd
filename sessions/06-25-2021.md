Setting the Stage…

Party stands in complete darkness in the basement of the Church – no light can survive down here. 

Galphia busts out her book of Hymns, starts singing, and with her waterskin and blesses it, and starts to sprinkle it around. Now her 5 pounds of water is 4.82 pounds left to carry. 

We see the splattered blood is up all along the sides…we hear the slow deep breathing of the monster. 

Kearis offers to put a spell on someone to spider crawl up along the wall and into the ceiling…it was not received well for the team. DM questions, are you trying to follow the leader…?

Zola casts a fire spell upward, it misses and the ceiling of blood starts drip downward on to the team.

Roll for Initiative – combat begins. 

Kearis starts. 

Haricot recommends to start with a hug and then proceeds to say sorry in a Canadian accent…giggle giggle

Kearis decides to follow a passive route and want to talk to Doroo. 

Doroo is looking back and forth between Kearis and Zola – who to attack first. 

Doroo then quietly creeps up to Kearis. She feels the hair on her neck prick up. Just as quickly moves back into the dark. Doroo decides she’s too good-looking and want to continue creeping on her. 

Doroo’s gaze moves to Zola. Slash with claws. 8 damage. Zola yells. 

Lilith yells ‘duck’ to Irena and she throws to her right. The dagger whooshes through the air and it falls to the floor. Then she takes her shortsword in hand and slashes across the side. It hits a column. 

Zola casts channel of divinity to light through the magical darkness. No Doroo in sight.

Galphina casts chill touch. She aims it adjacent Irena. The ice fingers heard a squish and there is blood at the end of the ice fingers. Zola yells ‘she fingered him’. Giggle giggle. She then proceeds to bless more water and touched herself – BLESSED UP. 

Irena takes a step closer to the column and about to throw her rapier. It misses. 

Haricot whispers XX and it makes it frustrated and distressed - 16 psychic damage. Doroo is now revealed. Haricot perks up because he can now make a mockery of him! He yells this time GOTCHA BITCH, but no damage. 

Kearis busts out her shortbow. It does not hit. She’s pissed and takes out her javelin. Still not enough to hit. 

Doroo snickers and disappears again in a pool of blood. 

The blood that was splattered has now congealed back into Doroo. He regained some strength. 

Tries to attack Kearis, misses. Tries another time to Zola, misses. 

Nooooo that was my big attack! As he slithers back into a safe spot. 

Now knowing he likes to hide behind the columns, Lilith politely asks Irena to scootch a little and once in position she throws both daggers. 7 damage and then 4 damage. Doroo peaks out. Lilith uses her sneak attack – 10 damage. 



Zola is up. While asking the team what they have…Galphia offers to read a book and use blade of truth. Zola says no thank you and then Haricot raises his hand and offers up a hair brush he picked up in our travels…

Zola decides to cancel nonsense with nonsense. Takes out a mirror, affix it on top of his staff, and tries to show Doroo his reflection. Yells ‘hey look at yourself in the mirror’. 

Doroo is not phased. So Zola pivots and decides to uses toll the dead – 20 necrotic damage.

While Zola is mid action, Haricot continues to offer up support for Galphia to read the book that would require a long rest. Then Haricot asks what about speed reading? 

E (Galphia) is up next. 

She recalls that she had read this book. She opens it, a gust of coincidental wind, it opens to a page that she needs. She follows the instructions, takes out the remaining 4.8 pounds of water and blesses it. Then sprinkles a few drops on to her dagger and throws. It hits as it sizzles – 4 damage. 

The blood that was touched by the holy water is unable to congeal and dies. 

Dunk that shit in the holy water! There is yelling everywhere to dip the tip in the jug. 

Irena dips the tip and then throw her rapier – 8 sizzle damage. 

Haricot wonders if he drinks the holy water, would his dissonant sizzle whispers become holy sizzle whispers. DM said no, but Haricot proceeds to non-holy sizzle whisper – 13 damage. 

Then follows up with moist sizzle mockery – 4 damage and has disadvantage on his roll. 

Kearis takes out her shortbow – 4 sizzle damage. She takes her dagger, dips the tip in the moist holy water – 5 sizzle damage.

Doroo tries to collect the blood around the room once more to regain some strength. It fails. He shreeks! Heads towards the stairs. 

Lilith walks after him – stricken by the limitation of her character sheet. She makes it to the first floor. She takes her shortsword and slashes around. Nothing meets the tip of her sword. 

Zola walks as well. The rest of the team makes it to the room in the first floor. 

The rain is still pouring outside. 

There are bloody footprints that lead from the room to the hallway into the chapel where we had left Father Donovan praying. 

The team rushes into the hallway. 

Doroo is standing in front of Father Donovan. 

The rain is pouring into the Church. 

Doroo lunches at Father Donovan and pierces him with his hands. With his vampire broody hands and climbs up towards the broken stained glass windows and throws his father’s body against an exposed beam. 

Doroo screams ‘not now father and not every!’ and lunges out of the church window. 

Father Donovan is pierced on top of the chapel. 

In his last breath, Father Donovoan says ‘head to Valiki, but before you go, in the basement lies the first treasure’ and then dies. 

Haricot unapologetically says ‘oh my goodness, there is treasure in the basement!’

Lilith runs down to the basement. In the coroner where Doroo was there was a small chest. [DM – no, Haricot here was not another chest] Inside the chest, Lilith found the holy symbol of ravenkind. The first of three treasures that needs to be found to destroy Straud. 

Level up to 4.
