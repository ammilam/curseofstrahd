## Session Notes

Setting the Stage..

Windows are boarded and in disrepair. The Church had seen better days. While the team is agreeing on what to do next, and see a warm red glow coming from inside the Church…

Zola walks to the side of the Church and peers into the window. He casts detect good and evil. 

Haricot’s legs seem to have some issues…perhaps it is from the crippling remorse from what they’ve done to Irena’s father. We shall hope to unpack this later.

[5:15pm brief discussion about headphones…no idea why….]

Zola, with his yellow vision eyes, sees red claw marks and sees a broken stained glass window. The claw marks lead through that window. 

They walk to the back of the Church. The wind has started to pick up and the mist is getting thicker and thicker – a foreboding warning or just nature?

Crack, boom – thunder, lightning and heavy rain begins - and Kearis is spinning. Literally spinning.

They all run to the front door because Haricot had a wild and great idea to knock on the front door….

No one answers. 

Zola pushes on the door. It opens. 

The team looks ahead and see down the long hall there is a dude kneeling ahead. There is wailing from beneath the floorboards.

The team ignores the dude and decides to explore the doors…

Zola bluntly asks the DM, is this dude evil or not…. 

Haricot quietly goes into the first door. Nothing really, but there was a wooden symbol. He takes it and walks back out. 

Zola walks into a bedroom. Nothing. Disappointed but seems mildly perturbed he wasn’t confronted with a demon to fight. 

Kearis walks into a bedroom. Nothing. Clearly disappointed she found nothing. 

Galphina walks into another bedroom – there is what looks like a wooden sun-shaped relic on the cabinet and an oil lamp on a dresser. She looks to investigate. 

There is a parchment and quill pens with dried up ink. Two books - Hymns to the Dawn and the Blade of Truth. She takes the books. 

The team hears two strange voices - 

‘Father!’

‘I’m starving’

The team decides to ignore what they just heard and Kearis goes back to re-look at the front room. Both are trying to pry the chest open – all she notices is that the room is wet. Very strange. 

Kearis calls over Zola, Zola tries to investigate the ‘stupid box’ – a locked chest. He fails…the room remains wet. 

Haricot gives inspiration to Galphina. Haricot has given Galphina luck! She uncovers the wetness is slobber, saliva, and blood that is leading towards the box. 

No one is left except Lilith. She is not concerned about the locked chest. She walks towards the dude who is kneeling and crying.

She approaches the dude. 

The dude is crying and whimpering. She is not good with emotions and beckons Haricot to come and kneel next to him. 

Even more than Lilith, everyone had forgotten Irena’s existence. At the sight of the dude, she yells ‘Father Donovan!’

Is it really you Irena?

Yes, Father what happened here?

It’s my son. A week ago he was part of an insurrection with Ismark and a group of Baroviaons who could storm Ravenloft and confront Straud once and for all. They stormed the castle, but when he returned, he was not the same. 

When asked how was he not the same? He replied, ‘My son become hungry and was never full. Always looking for something to consume’.

Haricot, now for a third time asks Father Donovan who was in the casket….Father Donovan responds with ‘my son….. and looks at Haricot strangely. 

We hear a screeching ‘Father, you are lying!’

Father Donovan then shares I have buried my son (metaphorically). What is downstairs is NOT my son, Doroo. 

Haricot and Zola offers to help. 

Father Donovan shares he knows what needs to be done, but doesn’t want to be here for whatever comes next. He shares that the locked chest in the room is the passage way to the basement. 

Lilith picks the lock and the latch comes undone. She reaches down into the box. It’s heavy. The wood has swollen around the edges of the entrance way. 

Haricot runs over after getting Father Donovan Rocky Road ice cream in an effort to make him feel better. Sadly it does not make him feel better.

Haricot then runs over the Lilith and casts enhanced ability and gives Lilith bull’s strength. She had not done enough weight training and was unable to lift. 

Zola comes along and easily lifts the chest to reveal a hatch. 

It is pitch black. 

Haricot gives Zola the relic and it’s enchanted the relic with holy light. The bright relic is thrown down the hatch, down into the basement. An make-shift glow stick. 

They go down into the basement. 

A few of the team makes out writing on the wall – 

Eight appear before your eyes, and eight remain in schooled disguise. Avoid all magic in this room, Lest reckless steps ensure your doom. 

[5:56pm DM accidentally shares a spoiler alert…everyone is advised to look away. Zola proceeds to use the restroom, but Haricot does not care. He decides to journey onward anyway]

Haricot opens the door and was about to take the first step, but before he can Galphina yells – the warning! Advises not to step on any steps that use the letters M-A-G-I-C. 

Haricot steps on Y. It is a trap! Poisons start to leak….it cripples him by giving him the biggest migraine in the universe. Loses almost half his life.

Galphina and Zola are trying to solve the riddle to find the safe path to the other side. 

They have a theory. Galphina steps left. She is safe – riddle solved! Now to figure out all of the eight words to find the safe path.  

Haricot in his vertigo-ed ridden state – he keeps on moving forward…thankfully his few steps in front are safe. Finally, he stops, but then proceeds to move onward by himself further away from the team. 

The eighth word is revealed! 

Haricot again in his confused state – he debates throwing the doll. The team advises otherwise. Yet he continues to find objects in his knapsack to throw on these booby-trapped letters…

In a moment of clarity, he decides to jump instead of throwing objects on the floor. He jumps successfully. Due to his success, he freely starts running all along the trapped floor. He triggers another trap…

He is asked to save himself…it’s unsuccessful. His migraine is now a super migraine and he’s become delirious. Someone needs to get to him to save him before he does more undue harm on himself…

Kearis follows the path Haricot just completed. 

Jump the Y. 

Walk to the A. 

Walk diagonal to G. 

Haricot is yelling you can walk all the way through now! In his delirium he had forgotten she had to first jump the N. Thank goodness Kearis was listening carefully to Zola and Galphina. 

Jump the N. 

Walk all the way up to B. 

Walk left to the U. 

Galphina goes next. She jumps the Y, but was too quick and walks diagonally right after before walking up to the A. She’s able to catch her footing as she stumbles on another trap. She’s mildly hurt, but okay. 

Galphina resets and gets back to the A and then to the G. She tries to jump to the N – she stumbles and acid shoots into her face…she faceplants into the N. She is dead…

There lies the dilemma for the remining team. Her lifeless body is slumps over the N. 

Zola sees this from afar. He knows he can save Galphina. 

He jumps the Y. Walks to the A. Walk diagonally to the G and then jumps the N to the E. 

Zola turns back to pull Galphina’s lifeless body from the N. Zola pulls her dead body with all of his strength. It was sort of unsuccessful…but Galphina’s undead strength turned into weightlessness and Zola just barely got her on to the E. 

Lilith is the last person to follow the pathway. As she was about to take the jump over the Y, she notices the pressure plate under the Y. She carefully takes out her thieves’ tools and disables the hook that triggers the pressure plate. There is a slow whoooosh sound. The trigger mechanisms for the floor are disabled.

Zola tries to slide Galphina’s body across the floor. Galphina in her own attempt to save her life – rolls a saving throw. She gasps for breath – she is alive, barely, but alive. 

Kearis runs to the aid of her sister and gives her a potion of life. She regains some of her health back. Both are relieved. 

Haricot somehow finds some life somewhere because the scribe did not catch it. It is assumed it was legitimately earned.  

Where was Irena during all of this? No one knows…but as the team exited the room, Irena appears out of thin air. 

The underground space is bitch black. 

There is a figure in the corner of the room, but no one sees it. 

Galphina feels around the beam to find a clue. OW! She is pricked by a rusty needle and blood is dripping down her hand. In that moment, she recalls that she had not gotten her tetanus booster…

She is frantically trying to wash the wound. 

Haricot, unapologetic, is trying to cast some light and is pressuring the DM to spill the bean in what corner the figure is. He is eager to cast Fairy Fire. 

The DM is unmoving and does not spill the beans. 

Zola is instructed to cast detect good and evil. 

There is blood splattered EVERYWHERE on the floor…. that slowly leads to one corner near Lilith and Galphina. 

It is extremely foreboding and creepy….

The not-son is nearby. 

Unprovoked, Haricot, yells ‘who go-eth there?’

[scribe’s inner monologue] Was this the right move or did they give away their position? The journey must continue next session…
