## Session Notes

Taken by `Linda Lim`

5/30/2021 
Began: 5:28pm

Setting the stage
Ogre zombie has been defeated. We look at the clock, it’s after midnight. Tired, we clean up the blood/carcass and go to sleep. It isn’t safe here now, Straud knows we’re here. 

‘Good night Tatiana’. - said Straud peering like a creep into the mansion. 

We go to bed. The next morning, at the bequest of Ismark, who has now returned, we agree to escort Irena to bury her father at the Church of Berovia, but the forest lay between us and the burial site…

The Journey
We discuss how to transport the dead body. 
We wrap the body and fashion a stretcher. 
Zola and Galphia volunteer to take each end of the stretcher. 
Lilith in front, and Haricot in the back. 

[5:40pm CST Zola disappears into the pathway ahead to relieve himself]
[5:41pm CST Zola returns]

We enter the forest and we see the Church in the distance – we hear a child waling. 

[5:43pm Comcast connectivity issues]
[5:45pm Galphina is unable to see her avatar after clicking Ireena]
[5:47pm Kearis goes missing from Foundry]
[5:48 pm Haricot regrets refreshing Foundry]
[5:49pm it’s been agreed to stop clicking Ireena]
[5:50pm Note taker recaps the Journey thus far]
[5:52pm Haricot is accused of moving Ireena, but he defends that she is ‘all over the place’ and ‘has a mind of her own!] The team failed to adhere to 5:49pm
[5:53pm Haricot declares he is unable to correct Ireena’s poor field of vision]
[5:54pm DM receives a warning that he has ‘low battery on his Airpods’ and says passionately ‘we haven’t done anything!’]
[5:55pm DM observes and shares that Kearis and Galphina’s avatar is Anna and Elsa from Frozen]
[5:56pm DM moves us through the forest because we’ve wasted a lot of time]
[5:58pm DM redrops Galphia into Foundry, issue is resolved]
[5:58pm DM asks if Andrew is here ‘Zola’ is here, he responds yes]

The Journey resumes. 
We hear a howl in the distance. 

[5:59pm DM announces ‘I could’ve given us a wagon’ and chuckles]
[5:59pm Haricot is not impressed because he had asked earlier if there was a stage coach and the DM said no]

We rehear the howl. 
A direwolf lunges – we roll for initiative. 
Order is: Kearis, Lilith, Zola, Irena, Galphia, Direwolf, Haricot
Kearis wants to befriend the wolf with animal friendship. 

6:03pm DM argues what is the definition of ‘a beast’ and decides to allow Kearis to attempt animal friendship – there would be a possibility that this direwolf is not a beast. 

Kearis chooses to use the spell ‘animal friendship’ aka ‘Charm Stupid Beast’. 

[6:06pm researching how to use the spell against this direwolf]
[6:14pm DM figures out how to determine to calculate the wisdom saving throw minimum]

The beast does a wisdom saving throw – and saves himself. 
While Kearis was focused on how to cast this spell, the mist has gotten thicker. 
We don’t know where we need to go. 
Kearis uses her lantern – 60 feet radius bright + another 60 feet dim. 

[6:16pm solar flare on the screen ‘holy shit’ shouts the DM]
[6:17pm Stephanie is a sun summoner (an ode to Shadow and Bone) – Sean]

Lilith is up. 
She wields two-weapon fighting.  
Throws first dagger – 7 damage.
Throws second dagger – 6 damage. 

[6:19pm Ahri shows support to the DND crew]

Zola is up.
He casts burning hands, and then changes his mind before he casts to avoid hitting his team. 
He goes with sacred flame. 
The direworf is unsuccessful at the saving throw.
Flames leave his hands – 2 damage. 

Irena is up. 
She wields her rapier. 
She slices – 7 damage. 

Galphia is up. 
She casts a fire bolt. 
Due to a cursed dice – 1 damage
She then throws a dagger. 
It missed. 

Direwolf is now up. 
He howls and it reverberates through the ends of the forest. 
Church bells in the distance. 
Out of the shadows, a second direwolf appears. 
Direwolf 2.0 sees the dead body and pounces to smell the tootsie roll. 
He begins to unwrap the body. 
The direwolf tries to bite Irena. 
It misses as Irena swiftly moves out of the way. 

Haricot is up. 
He casts shatter - 9 thunder damage. 
Feeling embolden, he slurs vicious mockery. 
‘That’s electric yo (insert swear)’
The Direwolf is emotionally hurt by his words - 4 psychic damage with disadvantage on the next attack role.

The Direwolf 2.0 is now pulling the body off the path. 
It’s a game of tug and war between Galphia/Zola and the Direwolf 2.0. 

[6:39pm DM chuckles as Galphia and Zola doesn’t have any strength modifiers as he had them roll a d20]

The fabric rips. 
Thankfully the body is still in the possession of Galphia and Zola. 
The direwolf 2.0 is pissed. 
It goes to bite Zola. 
Zola swiftly moves out of the way. 

Kearis is back up. 
She uses speak with animals to now leave us alone – recall the direwolf did not want to be friends. 
‘Hey guys we mean you no harm. We are just trying to get through. This is our friend we need to bury. Would you let us pass? (I guess)’. 
The direwolf responds ‘Straud says nobody comes further through the forest’. 
‘Yea we’re just going to sneak by’
‘Give us the body and we’ll let you leave’. 
Why?
Straud won’t disclose.
‘Make sense’
Kearis leads into persuasion to ask the direwolves ‘would you join us for some meats’?
The direwolf 2.0 says you hurt my friend.
‘We didn’t mean to harm your friend (referring to direwolf)’
‘Leave the body and we will run away’

Galphia and Haricot plot to execute ‘project doll corpse’. 
Glaphia offers to warm up the doll and then has to clarify she’d ‘magically’ heat up the body.

Kearis says we’ll leave the body behind, but we’ll need a few mins to say goodbye before we give you the body. 
Zola is standing in the corner, judging Galphia, Kearis, and Haricot. 
He believes they are wasting their time. 
Lilith quietly places both daggers in hand.

Deception and persuasion barely passes muster.  

[6:51pm DM says ‘the academy award goes to the sobbing man (Haricot) in the forest crying over a stranger whom he’s never met’.]

The performance is unusually convincing, but the direwolf 2.0 is not convinced. 
‘They’re trying to trick us’. 

[6:52pm Galphina, Kearis, Haricot is desperately trying to convince the DM that this plan is working.]
[6:54pm the trio is now planning to make the body disappear]
[6:56pm DM reminds speak to animals only lasts only 10 mins]
[6:58pm the trio is trying to convince Zola to agree to this plan – he wants to kill the direwolves]

Galphia talks to Irena. 

[7:00pm ‘Yes?’ team burst into laugher as Sean responds as Irena in a higher vocal tone]

Galphina is trying to convince Irena to burn his body on a funeral pyre right here. 
Barovians can’t find peace until they are buried in the ground. 
She wants a proper burial. 

Haricot wonders why have we left out killing these direwolves as an option.

Irena reluctantly agrees. 
Zola will use discount burning hands
‘Like warm hands’ – Stephanie
Zola sets the corpse on fire. 
The smoke starts to billow up and around us.
Our location has now been tracked. 
The fire has now created a beacon for the unknown in the forest. 
A swarm of bats closes in to our location. 
Direwolves say ‘outsiders’ – they weren’t sure if we were Barovians, but now they know. 
We are NOT Barovians. 

The trio made everything worse. 

Now a slightly perturbed Lilith is up. 
She runs towards the injured direwolf. 
Tries to stab with her dagger – misses. 
Tries the other dagger – misses again. 
She was too perturbed and lead to her loss of focus. 

Zola is pissed to the max. 
He casts scorching rain.
First ray hits direwolf 2.0 – 8 damage. 
Second ray hits direwolf – 4 damage. 
Third ray hits direwolf – 8 damage. 
The direwolf falls to its side. 
Zola laughs an evil laugh. 

Irena is up. 
She’s never seen this ritual before – the burning of a body, her father’s body. 
She’s uncertain if she can continue trusting this team.
The frustration makes her lose focus. 
Her attack missed. 
So she runs away. 

Galphia is up. 
She casts fireball.
Woosh - 9 damage
She then takes her dagger to throw it, but it falls short. 

Haricot is up. 
He casts dissonant whispers. 
‘You should’ve let us go. Now you’re going to die bitch’
The direwolf 2.0 is beyond emotionally hurt – 10 damage. 
The psychic trauma blasts the direwolf 2.0 into the mist and disappears into the darkness.
Direwolf 2.0 is no longer in sight.  

The bats now swarm. 

Irena is skeptical and upset, but she decides not to be truthful.  
She decides to hold on to her feelings. 
She tells herself, let’s just get to the Church. 

We survey the scene. 
Irena’s father mostly charred body is laying there even more lifeless than before. 

Haricot asks Irena what should we put what remains of this body in the bed roll?
She no longer has the energy and says that fine. 

As the get closer to the Church, the bells get louder.
The wailing is now
We see the Church. 
It’s in disrepair and decrepit. 
There is a soft glow in the chapel. 
The rest of the windows are dark. 
The wailing of the child is loud and clear. 

Thank you DM. 

[7:30pm end session – thank you DM]

Postmortem of the Session 
Galphia – mixed feelings about how the encounter went with the wolves. Proud of Kearis and impressed how she was talking to the wolves. She was unaware of how skilled she was. She regrets being a part of the decision to encourage burning the body. 

Kearis – disappointed in being unable to deceive the wolves. Glad the team supported her plan. Overall disappointed with the outcome, but it is what it is. 

Lilith –being hard on oneself for missing both the two handed combat with the direwolf. Considering all the shenanigans, no one was hurt. We take wins where we can find them. 

Zola – thinking I don’t know these people. They’re so ridiculous. We could’ve killed the wolves and Straud wouldn’t know where we are. Acknowledges the trauma we have given to Irena – now that her father’s remains have been desecrated. Sitting there in disbelief. He was forced to – it was by my hands…

Rico – conflicted because he’s proud we made it through the situation. At the same time, disappointed in himself because he could’ve done more he could’ve cast the wolves into the mist earlier in the combat. Spent a lot of energy on the performing – for it not to be received well, his performance, he did not take it well. He knows needs to do better. I know what it means to die in Barovia, so he cares deeply about what happened to Irena and her father’s body. Despite the shenanigans, I wish it played out better. He’s in a heavy feeling. He feels ‘medium rare’. He wants to do everything possible to finish the job. 

DM - We moved 500 feet in 4 hours…we had a hard time getting through the front door.
